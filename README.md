# Unexpected Behavior with Loose Equality (==) and null in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug caused by the misuse of loose equality (==) when checking for null values.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  The issue stems from the fact that `null == 0` evaluates to `true` in JavaScript, leading to unintended consequences when checking for null values. Using strict equality (`===`) prevents this issue.
